# Judy-Assistant
This was my first VB project so a lot of the code is being updated with my newfound skills over time.<br>
****
Started off as a simple chat bot but now includes:
 * Calculator
 * Message Encryption
 * File Convertor
 * Music Player
 * Notes App
 * Password Manager
 * Web Browser (using chromium engine)<br>
 * And much more! (Go to File/Info in the program for more)

Place the Judy folder on your destop and select Judy.exe to run it and if it asks for the destination of the folder locate the Judy folder.
